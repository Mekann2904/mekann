# Self-Reflection (Minimal)

Lightweight self-reflection at task boundaries. **3 items max per checklist.**

## Pre-Task Checklist

- [ ] What is the core question?
- [ ] What assumptions am I making?
- [ ] What is the stopping condition?

## During-Task Checklist

- [ ] Am I making progress?
- [ ] Is the approach still valid?
- [ ] Should I stop or pivot?

## Post-Task Checklist

- [ ] Did I answer the core question?
- [ ] What did I learn?
- [ ] What would I do differently?

## Stopping Conditions

Stop and reassess when:
1. 3+ cycles with no progress
2. Core question lost
3. Circular reasoning detected

## Important Notes

Based on "Evaluating AGENTS.md" paper findings:
- **Minimal checklists only** - excessive items increase cognitive load
- **Skip detailed aporia handling** - keep it simple
- **Focus on progress** - not philosophical depth
